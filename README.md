- You logo in vector white

## How to use it

1. Fork / clone the repository or [download the file](https://github.com/pingouin-creation/Sketch-Windows-10-uwp-template/raw/master/Windows%20uwp%20asset.sketch)
2. Import your logo in the logo page
3. Resize it in the different artboards
4. Be sure to not expand from the pink rectangle
5. Hide all the pick rectangle
6. Click on the artboard and export it
7. It will give you all the needed files

It will not export the percent scale (100, 125 , 150, 200, 400) but rather the width in pixels. 

In Visual Studio you have the "Scale size", but just below the square, you have the size in pixel.
